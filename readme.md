# Blockchain & Crypto Model Context Protocol Servers

This repository highlights Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers specifically designed for interacting with **blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies, and Web3 ecosystems**. These servers leverage the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) (MCP) to provide Large Language Models (LLMs) with secure, controlled access to on-chain data, transaction capabilities, smart contract interactions, and other crypto-specific tools.

The servers listed demonstrate how MCP can bridge the gap between LLMs and the decentralized world, enabling powerful new applications in areas like DeFi analysis, NFT management, on-chain automation, and crypto data retrieval. Each MCP server is implemented with either the [Typescript MCP SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk) or [Python MCP SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk).

> Note: Lists in this README are maintained in alphabetical order.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Using an MCP Client
Running a server on its own isn't very useful. It should be configured into an MCP client (like Claude Desktop, or custom applications).

For example, a hypothetical Claude Desktop configuration to use the EVM server might look like:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "evm": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@mcpdotdirect/server-evm", "--rpc-url", "https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_ID"]
    }
  }
}
```
*(Note: Refer to the specific server's documentation for correct installation and configuration commands)*
